# Blogging my PhD
This is the repository where the files for my blog are kept.  
Website url: https://lucy924.github.io  
I followed multiple tutorials, but the basic one I started with is https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart  
I then found the Jekyll template *Not Pure Poole* and ended up effectively copying this code and changing the parts I needed (thank you Songzi Vong!).
