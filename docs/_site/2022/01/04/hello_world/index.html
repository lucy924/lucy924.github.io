  <p>Good morning!<br />
My very first blog post is all about my thoughts as I begin to plan out and get ideas for my 3-year PhD project in Wellington, New Zealand.</p>

<p>I have been in the research and development department for a cancer treatment research company since I finished my Honours degree in 2016. As our department began moving in new directions I decided to take a look at what I wanted out of my career (disease and treatment research), my lifestyle (world travel with my husband) my current life situation (coupled with the world’s situation - eek!) and landed on the decision to spend the next three years doing a PhD in my home city of Wellington.</p>

<p>The intent of this blog series is to follow my life through this period of time. At this point I don’t know exactly what I want to include, but I do want to record some of the technical things that I learn, as well as thoughts on my career and research decisions. I also don’t know how often I’ll be updating, I’ll try to make it every 2 weeks!</p>

<p>I have applied for scholarships but it’s not a great time of year to be applying for them and I will have to try again soon. I am very grateful that I can continue working on a contract basis until I have funding sorted. My current boss has been super supportive, and has been giving me tips and advice on going through a doctoral program and planning out my research, which has been so helpful - I plan to put it to use in the next few weeks as I begin planning my PhD in ernest. I currently have a great overall hypothesis but only two suitable aims - I need to flesh them out and decide on a third. Hopefully a well-planned proposal will help with scholarship applications, but my doctoral supervisor reckons the decisions around here are more down to how many papers I’ve published, which apparently is not enough at this point!</p>

<p>There are numerous reasons for wanting my career to be focused in industry, they will probably come out during the course of this blog series, but the experience of applying for funding at the moment is definitely one of them! I’m very grateful that I won’t have to do too much of it during my studies. I’m very thankful my supervisor is supportive of this choice.</p>

<p>This post seems to be a litany of thankfulness. It is a good reminder that even if I can’t start immediately, I have much to be thankful for already.</p>

<p>- L</p>
