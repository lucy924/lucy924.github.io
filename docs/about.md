Hi I'm Lucy de Jong. I start my PhD on the 1st of May 2022, and have decided to blog this journey. This is a place for me to get down my thoughts and feelings throughout my PhD journey in immunology and epigenetics, along with other things I learn along the way. I plan to include some help pages for code I need to figure out, links that are useful, and maybe even some help for things I do in the lab too. Feel free to add some of your own thoughts in the comments (coming soon!), and happy reading :D
