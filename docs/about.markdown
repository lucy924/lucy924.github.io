Hi! I'm Lucy de Jong, I'm about to start my PhD, and have decided to blog this journey. I don't know when I'm starting yet, which is all part of the fun! This is a place for me to get down my thoughts and feelings throughout my PhD journey. I plan to include some help pages for code I need to figure out, links that are useful, and maybe even some help for things I do in the lab too. Feel free to add some of your own thoughts in the comments, and happy reading :D
