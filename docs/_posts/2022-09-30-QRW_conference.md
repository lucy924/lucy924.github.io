Dorood! :iran:  
So it's been awhile... because I was doing a pile of data analysis and research to present a poster at QRW this year, which was a fantastic experience. :star:

Wow! I came back on a high, buzzing with ideas and excited about contacts I made, and then my friend told me to make the most of the high because conference highs will calm down soon enough. 
The conference was from 29/08/22 to 01/09/22, and I went to the [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/)-hosted "Empowering Precision Oncology through Genomics" conference the day before that, so the week was super full on. The day after it all finished, I spent the entire day yawning pretty much every 30 seconds because I was so wiped out. 

Networking! I hate the idea but once I get talking to people that are interested in the same things I am I guess it's not too bad. I had great chats with people from [Oxford Nanopore Technologies](https://nanoporetech.com/) and came back from it absolutely certain that I want to do nanopore sequencing to get methylomes of my cancer cell assay.

Helpful to my area of study, I learned a lot about the immune landscape of cancer and how it fits into immunotherapy, and about research in completely different fields (like agriculture) that employs similar principles to mine. 

The conference this year had a large focus on Māori voices and indigenous research, which was fabulous to see and long overdue. I now want to work on ensuring that the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Treaty of Waitangi) are considered in my research - plus I now have a list of books and articles to read surrounding this topic!

This experience, particularly at the Illumina conference, has given me a much greater understanding of desired directions for Aotearoa NZ in genomic medicine and cancer management. 
Aotearoa is well behind other comparable OECD countries when it comes to genomic medicine which is really sad - most of our research money goes into agriculture rather than health, and much of our healthcare system doesn't have any integration of genomics at all. 
I came back from this conference wanting to find a way to lean my career towards improving our genomic medicine systems such that all patients in Aotearoa can access an appropriate standard of care that is similar to other developed nations.

I went to this conference with a very broad goal in mind of learning more about my field and increasing my breadth of knowledge of molecular biology research in Aotearoa. 
Not only did I develop a deeper understanding of the immune system in the context of cancer and immunotherapy, I also came away with an understanding of the importance of including Māori and Pasifika perspectives in my research as a whole.

If any new PhD student is wondering if they should take an opportunity to go to a conference early on in their study, I say without hesitation to go for it! It was really great going into it with a very loose idea of what I was going to do, it allowed me to go in a direction that is personally inspiring and socially relevant.

I had a lot of fun! Next time I will post my work on immune infiltrate in solid cancer that I presented at the conference.
