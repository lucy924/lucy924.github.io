Kamusta ka! :philippines:  
Better late than never - but I kept some cells alive!

I spent last week frantically reading about bladder cancer cell lines to determine what ones are best for what I plan to do with them to order them on time, and this week frantically putting together an abstract for a poster I plan to do at the Queenstown Research Week conference I'm suddenly attending. 
So it's been all go and I've been unable to write until now - the cells were ordered on Wednesday and the abstract sent in this morning!

I'm back in the lab for the first time in about 5 years, learning how to do cell culture which is new to me. I used to deal with just DNA and RNA most of the time, sequencing library prep, gel electrophoresis, that kind of thing. My teachers have me learning cell culture techniques on Jurkat cells, which are a cell line derived from a T cell leukemia. It is very proliferative and easy to grow, but should be used with caution in experiments as the mutations it has sometimes cause some unexpected effects if you aren't aware of them.

I will do a post on literature review reading and writing at some point when I have more of it done, though most of it will be links to great resources I've found for doing them - no sense in reinventing the wheel there!

So this has come a little later than I wanted; I've been a bit pressed for time recently. One of the things I need to work on is time management, I struggle with having multiple "balls in the air" as they say. Hopefully I get on top of it soon!
