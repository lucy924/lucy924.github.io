Cześć! :poland:  
Back at the desk and coding again!

Update on my last post: my Jurkat cells survived successfully! And after I spent two weeks carefully nurturing these cells to grow... they went into the bleach and tipped down the drain (deliberately! but it's still a little sad :cry:).

So I realise at this stage this blog is more like a small diary, and it's been awhile since I wrote because I've been so busy.  
I have some plans as to how I want these posts to go, but it's tricky getting the ideas down in the right places at the right times. I often feel like doing this blog is distracting me from my "real work", but I know it is all part of the PhD experience that *I* want to have and develop, plus it is good to have more of myself out there in terms of career development.  
Some of my problems stem from the fact that I am a "big picture" person - if I can't see an overall picture, I have real difficulty focussing on the task at hand, I am always flitting from one thing to another. This is the main reason why I am a bit hung up on "planning my phd".   
I've been advised to look at the SMART goal structure, and found a really nice blog post about writing SMART goals [here](https://ptsdtophd.com/?p=86) and a post about integrating different project management resources together for the PHD student [here](https://academiac.net/2018/11/27/project-management-resource-for-phd-students-and-supervisors/). I hope to utilise them early next week.

### My goals for next week include:
1. Laying out a timetable for myself
  - I have not been structured at all in how I approach my work, which is probably part of what led to the feeling of being completely lost in my first month. I tend to stick to one project at a time, and often feel like I should be devoting all my attention to it at once. Which is probably why I haven't been updating this blog!
2. Organise my systems (more of a month goal I guess)
   - These involve:
     - OneNote as a central place where I dump all my notes, lab work, and literature review matrices
     - VSCode for my code, including statistical analysis and markdown notebooks as an equivalent of the lab notebooks.
     - Scrivener for writing my thesis and other publications that come out of it.
   - As I have stated before, I will detail this organisational system in a post one day - when I have it sorted!
1. Get a figure out of my methylation data from CIBERSORTx (This is what I'm developing code for at the moment - I'll post more detail on this project once I have presented it in September)
2. Gathering information for a review paper I'm working on with another PhD student (link to this will be posted when we finish it).

Hopefully by the end of the month I'll have settled into a manageable routine, and maybe these posts will come a little more frequently and maybe with a little more structure.
