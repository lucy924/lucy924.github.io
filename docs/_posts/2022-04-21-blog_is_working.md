Kia Ora! :new_zealand:  
Well this blog is finally up and running :relieved: 

If you follow me from this beginning, expect some changes to this format as I navigate/learn/tinker with GitHub pages, Jekyll, website development, social media ... well everything I guess.  

Some updates from the last post: 
- I got a university scholarship which is a big relief!
- I finished up at work on Tuesday
- My project plans have gone out the window and re-entered in a more general and hopefully more manageable form (I will do a post about my studies once I figure out more of them and what I should/should not publish here)

I have two weeks break before I officially start my studies, and I plan to use it tinkering with this blog, catching up on <a href="#reading">reading</a>, doing some admin work for [Predator Free Churton Park](https://www.facebook.com/predatorfreechurtonpark/) and getting through a chunk of my To Do list. How much will actually get done? Probably not as much as I hope!
