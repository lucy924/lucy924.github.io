Talofa lava! :samoa:  
I've been doing this for nearly a month and I now have project that's beginning to take shape. :books:

Updates from the last post: 
- I got my ID card - and then had some shenanigans to get access to the places I needed access to, but that's all sorted now.
- I wrote out about half of my initial experimental protocol and then went "oh I need to do more reading around this before I go any further" and viola! I started planning out my literature review. 

I'm also going through the lab induction protocols with our lab technician and getting familiar with the study environment which I've been out of for the last 4 years.
During my academic reading so far I find myself frustrated with comments like "this will assist in future therapeutic developments" when papers talk about epigenetic discoveries. To my (admittedly limited) knowledge so far, there aren't many effective methods of delivery for epigenetic therapies. As I understand it, existing epigenetic therapies target the enzymes that put epigenetic marks on and off (makes sense) but this is very likely to have unintended effects if given orally/systemically. I'd love to be corrected though, I know I need to do more reading of the topic at least. Maybe some of those enzymes are only active in particular tissues. 

So far in my career I have been using my maiden name, but due to a number of reasons (passports and anticipating future jobs outside of Aotearoa being a major one) I have decided to change my name completely. I thought the beginning of a PhD would be a good time to do this, however I do have a few publications out under my maiden name which is nice! 
I do have family members who successfully use both names, their married name for personal and their maiden name for their career, and I tried to do this but it got too complicated in the end. The fact that the English speaking world has difficulty with names that don't start with a capital letter and is one word is a contributing factor! It was not an easy decision to change my name, I am proud of my family and my Dutch heritage. 

So this post ended up coming a fortnight after the last one - progress in the frequency department! I'm aiming to get these out once a week.  
Right - on to my reading!
