This is a place for me to get down my thoughts and feelings throughout my PhD journey in immunology and epigenetics, along with other things I learn along the way.  
I plan to include some help pages for code I need to figure out, links that are useful, and maybe even some help for things I do in the lab too.  
Feel free to add some of your own thoughts in the comments!
