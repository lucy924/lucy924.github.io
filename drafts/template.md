Hi!  
- Do this stuff in vscode, it has automation. 
- introduce myself (actually this should go on the homepage)

Plan for post:  
- scholarship stresses
- plan to go into industry
- thoughts about differences in academia and industry
- acknowledge is different for everyone
- thankful for my supervisor who is fully supportive of these plans
- financial stability
- ideal world
- thoughts on ideal world might change during phd

Another blog post
- learning about planning a whole phd and a research proposal
- my weird brain and wanting to do EVERYTHING 
- I like big picture
- can't figure out small picture until I can fit it into the big picture
- don't like leaving things hanging

Another post
- skills I currently have
- What tools I use (i.e. vscode)
